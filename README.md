You can use my modified boilerplate which I just slightly modified to get rid of errors.

## What I did

-   âœ¨Magic âœ¨

## Requirements

- VSCode &
- Its two extensions : `EsLint` , `Prettier`

## Till now, I haven't go any bug then just do the following method:

- Just keep a empty directory
- Download the whole repo
- Copy and paste the files in your directory
- Run the command:
`npm install` if you use npm or `yarn` if you use yarn
- Now check it by `npm start` or `yarn start`
- I hope it is working now!
